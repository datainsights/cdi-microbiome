# Welcome to CDI – Unlocking Microbial Insights {-}

Welcome to the **Microbiome Data Science Q&A Guide**, part of the Complex Data Insights (CDI) open learning series.

This guide helps you make sense of microbial abundance, diversity, and metadata — all through a practical, question-driven approach. Whether you're a student, researcher, or data enthusiast, you'll explore key concepts step by step using real microbial datasets and modern tools.

Let curiosity guide you — and let the data speak.

CDI breaks down complex topics into four progressive layers, designed to be explored individually or as an integrated journey:

- 🔍 **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
  Understand your data — explore its structure, patterns, and quirks.

- 📊 **VIZ (Visualization)**  
  Communicate findings through clear and compelling visuals.

- 📐 **STATS (Statistical Analysis)**  
  Test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty using sound statistical methods.

- 🤖 **ML (Machine Learning)**  
  Build models to predict, classify, and uncover deeper insights.

**CDI helps you grow — one Q&A at a time.**
