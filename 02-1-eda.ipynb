    "# What are the essential tools for microbiome read quality control?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Every microbiome analysis begins with raw sequencing data, often in the form of FASTQ files. These files contain both the nucleotide reads and quality scores. However, raw reads are rarely perfect — they may contain adapter sequences, low-quality regions, or even contaminant DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to any taxonomic or functional profiling, it's essential to clean and assess these reads. This is the foundation of your analysis pipeline — ensuring that only high-quality data moves forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tools have been developed for this exact purpose. Most are installable via **Bioconda**, and they can be used independently or as part of an automated pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of what each tool does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seqkit**: Provides basic statistics about your FASTQ files (e.g., length distribution, GC content).\n",
    "- **FastQC**: Generates per-base quality score plots to detect poor-quality cycles.\n",
    "- **MultiQC**: Aggregates FastQC outputs across samples into a single report.\n",
    "- **BBMap / Trimmomatic**: Trim adapters, remove artifacts, and perform quality filtering.\n",
    "- **Kneaddata**: Specialized for metagenomics, it removes contaminant reads (e.g., host DNA) using alignment-based filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shell Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install individual tools using mamba and bioconda\n",
    "mamba install -c bioconda seqkit fastqc multiqc bbmap trimmomatic\n",
    "# Install kneaddata from Biobakery channel (for metagenomics)\n",
